      <h3>Next: Review tasks</h3>
      <p>We will show you several commits from a software system and ask you to review them.</p>
      
      <p>It is of utmost importance that you take these reviews seriously.</p> 
      <p>Like in real life, you should <i>find as many defects as possible</i> and you should <i>spend as little time as possible</i> on the review.
      Unlike in real life, we are not interested in maintainability or design issues, but <i>only in correctness defects</i> ("bugs").
      Examples of defects are code that does not work as intended under all circumstances, code that will lead to unintended exceptions, but also
      simple typos in messages. A defect can belong to a single part of the code, but it can also be due to the incorrect interaction of several parts
      of the code.</p>
      <p>Please assume that the code compiles but has not been tested very well, if at all.</p>
